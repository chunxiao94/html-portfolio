    <h1>A little peek into the me outside of work</h1>
    <h2>Zoology</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>I get really excited when a quiz asks a question on animals and I make it a point to 
            memorise as many species of the animal kingdom as possible. My interest must've been 
            sparked in elementary school where we were given little booklets to complete with 
            animal diagrams and facts.<br />
            If I ever get the chance, I would certainly like to pursue a career in veteniary sciences.

    <h2>Singing</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>Before you start asking where I've performed, I would like to clarify that my definition of 
            singing is confined to the walls of my apartment and the shower.
            Something that I've been wanting to learn is harminisation so I can confuse and terrorise my
            fellow karaoke buddies.
        </p>
    </h3>
    <h2>Games</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>As a child I was deprieved of games. Which might be the reason why I am so drawn to them.
            Through a game called Dota2, I met the love of my life and we have spent many evenings
            "collaborating" virtually despite being only 2 metres apart.
        </p>
    </h3>
    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>In my middle school years, we had to cook as part of our curriculum and I had my first baking experience.
            With limited guidance, money and therefore equipement, my baking adventures were curtailed.
            Recently I came across a simple looking recipe on a Reel and decided to give it a shot.
            Since then I've baked 2 loaves successfully and I'm thinking of croissants next. God bless my soul.
